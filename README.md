# MY_LEARNINGS

A structured repository containing my Computer Science learning notes and implementations, focused on writing clean, understandable, and reusable code.

This repo is part of my long-term preparation for:
- Problem Solving (DSA)
- Core CS Foundations
- Open Source contribution
- Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026

---

## 📌 Highlights
- 📚 Well-organized learning notes and code implementations
- ✅ Clean, modular code written with good practices
- 🧠 Covers DSA, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Trees, etc.
- 🛠️ Written mostly in **C++** (and some Python / notebooks where required)
- 🔁 Actively updated as I learn and revise
